ColorHap is a random color generator for developers and creatives. It allows you to generate a vast array of colors, including basic, web, named, attractive, and true random colors. Stuck on a design decision? Spark your inspiration with unexpected color combinations.

Beyond randomization, ColorHap lets you browse and select specific colors with ease, get precise color information (including hex codes, RGB, HSV, HSL, and more), or save your favorite generated colors for later use. Share color codes and visual swatches directly with collaborators, or simply send yourself colors you discover and like!

Available as a native Android app and a Progressive Web App (PWA), ColorHap runs on multiple platforms without ads or internet access. It's a free and open-source project built with Flutter for exploring endless color possibilities and finding inspiration for any project.
