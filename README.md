# ColorHap

ColorHap is a versatile random color generator designed to spark creativity with millions of colors, including basic, web, named, attractive, and random true colors. Itâ€™s perfect for artists, designers, developers, and anyone working with colors, offering an easy way to shuffle, copy, reuse, and share colors.

The latest update introduces a Full-Screen Color Preview for an immersive color experience and a redesigned Color Info Screen for a cleaner layout. Quick actions like long-press to copy codes and double-tap to preview colors improve usability. Enhanced layout for large screens ensures a better visual experience.

Available as a native Android app and a Progressive Web App (PWA), ColorHap runs on multiple platforms without ads or internet access. It's a free and essential tool for exploring endless color possibilities and finding inspiration for any project.
